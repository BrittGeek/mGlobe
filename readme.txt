mGlobe: Modelling of global mass effects in hydrology, atmosphere and 
oceans on surface gravity

This toolbox allows user to compute the global hydrological, 
atmospheric and non-tidal ocean loading effects on surface gravity. 
No test data were uploaded with this code because of 
provider's conditions of use. The links to all supported models
are listed in the mGlobe_USER_MANUAL.pdf file. Please read this
file before using mGlobe. 
This version is designed for reviewing purposes (submitted to the
